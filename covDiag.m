function sigmahat=covDiag(Y,k)

% function sigmahat=covDiag(Y,k)
%
% Y (N*p): raw data matrix of N iid observations on p random variables
% sigmahat (p*p): invertible covariance matrix estimator
%
% Preserves sample variances but shrinks all sample covariances towards
%    zero, as in Appendix B.2 of Ledoit (1995, MIT PhD Thesis)
%
% If the second (optional) parameter k is absent, not-a-number, or empty,
% then the algorithm demeans the data by default, and adjusts the effective
% sample size accordingly. If the user inputs k = 0, then no demeaning
% takes place; if (s)he inputs k = 1, then it signifies that the data Y has
% already been demeaned.
